<h2>Indane Gas</h2>
<p> Indane is today one of the largest packed-LPG brands in the world and has been conferred the coveted Consumer Superbrand status by the Superbrands Council of India</p>
<br><p>Having launched LPG marketing in the mid-60s, IndianOil has been credited with bringing about a kitchen revolution, spreading warmth and cheer in millions of households with the introduction of the clean and efficient cooking fuel. It has led to a substantial improvement in the health of women, especially in rural areas by replacing smoky and unhe- althy chulha. Indane is today an ideal fuel for modern kitchens, synonymous with safety, reliability and convenience.</p>
<br>
<p>With the status of an exclusive business vertical within the Corporation, Indane is delivered to the doorsteps of 13.11 crore households. IndianOil's 94 Indane bottling plants in upcountry locations roll out over 2 million cylinders a day, making IndianOil the second largest marketer of LPG globally, after SHV Gas of The Netherlands. Indane is available in compact 5 kg cylinders for rural, hilly and inaccessible areas, 14.2 kg cylinders for domestic use, and 19 kg and 47.5 kg for commercial and industrial use. </p>
